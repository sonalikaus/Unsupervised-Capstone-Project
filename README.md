# Unsupervised-Capstone-Project
Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering Analysis

**DATA DESCRIPTION**


This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled.

In this project, we were required to do:

1.Exploratory Data Analysis

2.Understanding what type content is available in different countries

3.Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

4.Clustering similar content by matching text-based features
